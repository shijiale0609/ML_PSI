# Predicting Adhesive Free Energies of Polymer-Surface Interactions with Machine Learning

This repository contains an open source implementation of the machine learning model and corresponding dataset described in our paper.


## Abstract

Polymer-surface interactions are crucial to many biological processes and industrial applications of polymers. Composition significantly influences a polymer's structural and functional properties, such as its solubility and accessible conformations. Here we propose a machine-learning method to connect a model polymer's composition with its adhesion to decorated surfaces. We simulate the adhesive free energies of 20,000 unique coarse-grained 1D sequential polymers interacting with functionalized surfaces and build support vector regression models that demonstrate inexpensive and reliable prediction of the adhesive free energy as a function of the sequence. Our work highlights the promising integration of coarse-grained simulation with data-driven machine learning methods for the design of new functional polymers and represents an important step toward linking polymer composition with polymer-surface interactions.

## Dataset

The free energy is calculated by lammps and ssages in CG model with ABF sampling.
